# Polaris Emergency Preparation
#### By Renee Geffre, David Goodrich, Michael Kallgren, Brian Martin

## Quick Overview
### What this app is for

### Why we did it
  The impetus for this project came about during the Atlantic hurricane season of 2017. After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, people used social media to broadcast medical emergency information so first responder crews could get to the correct places. And after a double blow from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Puerto Rico’s infrastructure collapsed – no electricity but what portable generators could make,no running water, and numerous roads wiped away in the waters. The goal of Polaris is twofold: 
1.	We want to teach people how to help themselves in the immediate aftermath of disaster.
2.	We want to set up an easy tracking system for relief crews to get people the help they cannot give themselves.

### Why Article Vetting is So Important

In a survival situation, two things are incredibly lethal: __ignorance__ and __misinformation__.  The goal of this website is to help 


<!-- SECTION 3 - USE OF EMERGENCY PROFILE -->
<a id = "usingEmergencyProfile"></a>
# Use of Emergency Profile

The Emergency Profile is something that all registered users are strongly recommended to fill out. It is a tool first and foremost meant for use by relief crews to assist you and create a more cohesive "sitational awareness map" for their efforts. It is also a tool for allowing friends and family to be kept abreast of your situation in the event that they cannot contact you (and vice versa) directly.

The Emergency Profile is populated by the following fields:
1. Your name
2. Your street address

In the event of an emergency, you can update your emergency status with.

<!-- SECTION 5 - PRIVACY -->

# Privacy

<a id = "personalData"></a>
## Personal Data Access

The only individuals with access to your personal profile are:
  * You
  * Anyone you give your login access to (such as a personal emergency contact)

In the future, the only people who can see your location and emergency data ([see above](#usingEmergencyProfile)) will be yourself, anyone with your login info, and registered emergency crews. For the moment - while Polaris is going through development - all users can see all other users' location and emergency data on the emergency map.

<!-- SECTION 6 - TECHNICAL DATA -->

## Dependencies

## User Authentication

Polaris authenticates users using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a middleware client that provides user authentication and password management services. Polaris' and Auth0's administrative teams are the only individuals with access, and your password is protected by being hashed and salted (i.e. it will never appear as plain text.)
